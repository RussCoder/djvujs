The DjVu.js Library (everything that is in `library/src` directory) is subject
to, and may be distributed under,
the [GNU General Public License, Version 2](GNU_GPL_v2).

Everything else in this repository (including the DjVu.js Viewer and the browser
extension) is distributed under the terms of [The Unlicense](THE_UNLICENSE).

The choice of GNU GPL v2 for the library is conditioned by the fact DjVu.js
contains some code fragments copied from DjVuLibre or Java DjVu libraries, which
are distributed under this very license.

The DjVu.js Library isn't a port of DjVuLibre or Java DjVu, but the published
specification of the DjVu format refers to DjVuLibre as the de facto standard of
the DjVu format and advises to study its code. Also, some parts of DjVu codecs
aren't described in details and can be gotten only from the source code of
DjVuLibre.

Here I put all the copyright notices, which I found in the source files of both
DjVuLibre and Java DjVu.
