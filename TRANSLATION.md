# How to add a new translation to the viewer or improve an existing one

If you want to add one more translation to the viewer, 
you need to fulfill the following steps:

1. Copy [the Russian dictionary file](viewer/src/locales/Russian.js) and rename
   it according to the name of your language in English. Put your file into the
   same directory, where the Russian file is.

2. Then change all the Russian translations of English phrases with your own.
   You can look at
   the  [the English dictionary file](viewer/src/locales/English.js), which
   essentially does not translate anything. But it may serve you as an
   additional example.

3. Pay attention to **the topmost comments** in the Russian dictionary file.
   Especially, read about placeholders which start with #, e.g. #helpButton.
   Other comments throughout the file will help you to find where a phrase is
   used in the app. Some phrases you will not see if you start the viewer
   locally (not as in the extension). While others you can see only if you
   remove some phrases from a dictionary
   (namely notifications that the translation isn't complete), and start the
   viewer locally (it's written in [README](README.md) how to do it). But you do
   not need to find all phrases, you can translate some of them blindly.

4. If you want to **improve an existing translation**, the notification window
   should have told you what phrases are missing. So find where those phrases
   are placed in the Russian dictionary and add them with translations to the
   dictionary you want to improve. However, most probably untranslated phrases
   have been already added to the file, but with `null` values as placeholders.
   In this case, replace all `null` values with corresponding translations.
   Also, if there are missing phrases, but they are not present in the file, you
   can add them via the command `npm run syncLocales`. It should be run
   inside `viewer` directory.

You do not need to connect the dictionary to the code, I will do it myself.
However, if you want you can find where it's connected in the code and add it
there.
**But in general you need only to create a dictionary and nothing more.**

It's better to create **a pull request on GitHub**, but if you do not know how
to do it, and do not want to learn how to do it, you can just send the
dictionary at djvujs@yandex.ru and I will add it to the project myself.
