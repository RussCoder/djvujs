# DjVu.js Viewer

The viewer is built with React and it was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
The default build config is overridden with @craco/craco.
Thus, to understand how it is built look at `.env` and `craco.config.cjs` files.

The viewer is intended to be easily built into a web page via including 2 files - js and css.

You can see the demo here https://djvu.js.org/

To install all dependencies run `npm install`.

To build it run `npm run build`.

To debug it run `npm start`.
