# DjVu.js Library's Changelog

## v.0.5.3 (18.02.2021)

- Error handlers for unhandled promise rejections and errors in the worker.
- Object URL to the whole library code is created only once to avoid memory
  leaks.

## v.0.5.2 (18.02.2021)

- Use DIRM registry to get a page number by its id. This approach works the same
  for bundled and indirect documents.

## v.0.5.1 (09.01.2021)

- More robust memory management for document creation (usage of
  `WebAssembly.Memory` with its `grow()` method instead of manual `ArrayBuffer`
  expansion).
- `'use strict';` in the Web Worker (typo correction).
- Returned to the old behaviour: wait for the completion of a forgotten task,
  before sending the next to the Web Worker.

## v.0.5.0 (06.12.2020)

- Feature: bundle indirect djvu documents.
- Removed old redundant DjVuWorker's methods duplicating "doc" proxy API.
- Now callbacks can be passed to the DjVuWorker.
- Minor improvements.

## v.0.4.5 (18.11.2020)

- Use standard TextDecoder API to handle ill-formed utf-8 arrays.

## v.0.4.4 (28.10.2020)

- Significant reduction of memory consumption in IWDecoder (LazyBlock).
- Automatic reset of temporary IW structures after the decoding phase, if the image is big.

## v.0.4.3 (30.07.2020)

- Fixed a bug due to which an empty DJVI chunk caused an error.

## v.0.4.2 (30.06.2020)

- Fixed an error, which took place when there is no location.origin (when a web page is opened directly in a browser).

## v.0.4.1 (22.04.2020)

- Wrapped some loop's bodies into functions to avoid code deoptimizations in Chrome in some cases.

## v.0.4.0 (18.05.2019)

- png.js was integrated into djvu.js to create png files (and Object URLs to them) of the pages inside a worker. 
It's required for the continuous scroll mode, since a png file is much less than a raw ImageData object.

## v.0.3.5 (03.04.2019)

- Fixed a bug having taken place when there were more than 1 block in bzz encoded data.

## v.0.3.4 (30.03.2019)

- Now XHR is used instead of fetch(), since the latter can't load local files (i.e. file:/// urls).

## v.0.3.3 (02.03.2019)

- Fixed a bug. Now empty edges are removed for all symbols added to the dict.

## v.0.3.2 (11.02.2019)

- Fixed a bug when baseline (y coord) was computed incorrectly.

## v.0.3.1 (15.11.2018)

- New method for getting quantity of pages.
- Correct processing of page urls with leading zeros (like "#002").

## v.0.3.0 (12.10.2018)

- The support of indirect djvu files.
- Bug fixes.

## v.0.2.2 (14.09.2018)

- Rotation flags are processed now. A image of page is rotated by default if required.

## v.0.2.1 (20.08.2018)

- Empty pages are processed correctly.

## v.0.2.0 (16.06.2018)

- DjVuWorker is created from the Data URL which is generated automatically, so there is no need in explicit script URL. 
- Additional method run() for the DjVuWorkerTask (the proxy object which is return by the "doc" property of the worker).
- Utils.loadFile() is deprecated now.
- The whole script is available through the DjVu.DjVuScript() method, which is added as a wrapper in the build process. 

## v.0.1.9 (25.05.2018)

- TXT* chunks are decoded completely - text zones are decoded.
- Normalized text zones for the text layer of page. 

## v.0.1.8 (15.05.2018)

- New universal Proxy-based DjVuWorker API, allowing to automatically use most of methods of DjVuDocument.

## v.0.1.7 (19.04.2018)

- UTF-8 ids of pages and dictionaries are supported.

## v.0.1.6 (15.04.2018)

- JB2 codec performance optimizations (more efficient memory access)

## v.0.1.5 (05.04.2018)

- Old files with INFO chunks less than 10 bytes are supported.
- A specific error for corrupted files. 

## v.0.1.4 (27.03.2018)

- A table of contents can be gotten.
- A page number may be gotten by a url. 

## v.0.1.3 (25.03.2018)

- All worker tasks-promises can be cancelled now.
- A task is posted to the worker only after the previous one is fulfilled.

## v.0.1.2 (24.03.2018)

- Unified style of DjVuErrors, which are errors that are thrown manually, when a file is corrupted, there is no requested page and so on. 
- DjVuErrors are rather simple objects that may be copied between workers. 

## v.0.1.1 (19.03.2018)

- UTF-8 strings are decoded correctly now.

## v.0.1.0 (14.03.2018)

- IW44, BZZ and ZP codecs are fully implemented with some constraints in case of BZZ codec.
- JB2 codec is implemented only for decoding.
- BGjp, FGjp, Smmr are not supported at all.
- ANTa, ANTz, NAVM, FORM:THUM and TH44 are not supported, but there are dummies for them, so they are processed somehow.
- Support of TXTz and TXTa is implemented partly, only pure text is decoded.
- The library can split a djvu file, render pages, generate metadata of djvu files, and create a document from a set of images (using IW44 codec).
