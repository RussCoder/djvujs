# DjVu.js Library

This file contains some information about the inner structure of the project and about how to use the library.
It may be useful for you, if you want to play with code or contribute to the project.

It's implied that you have run `pnpm install` and all dependencies are installed correctly.

## Documentation

If you are interested only in the library's API [read it here](./API.md).

## How to use it

Besides the API docs, there is a good example script with many comments, which can give you a rather good understanding
how to use the library.
It's located at `library/debug/js/examples.js`.
To run it, you should clone the repository and in the root directory do the following:

```
cd library
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

After the debug server is run (usually on 9000 port) access `http://localhost:9000/examples.html` to see the results,
and then read the code
and the comments to understand how it works. You can edit the code (and the page will reload automatically).

Also, you can read source code of `DjVuDocument.js`, `DjVuPage.js` and `DjVuWorker.js` in the `src` directory to know
more about the API.

If you have more questions, feel free to create an issue.

## The structure

There are the following directories:

- `app` - contains an old application, which is poorly maintained now. It can split a djvu file, convert images to a
  document, and show metadata of a document.
- `assets` - contains test .djvu files and images. They are used in the automatic tests.
- `debug` - contains css and js files for debugging, which are not the part of the source code of the library.
- `dist` - a directory where the final bundle file is saved to (the eventual `djvu.js` file).
- `src` - a main directory, containing the source code of the library. Its inner structure is self-descriptive, at least
  I think so.
- `tests` - a directory containing tests, which are run in a browser.

There are the following pnpm commands that may be run:

- `start` - starts a local static server and runs a rollup watch command, which build the library and rebuild it on each
  change. Also, on each change of the bundle or a file from `js` folder, the server sends a message to a client script
  to reload the page.
- `watch` - just runs a rollup watch method, which builds the library and rebuilds it on each change.
- `build` - just builds the library once.

So if you don't know what to start with, run `pnpm start` and head to `http://localhost:9000/` - you will see the old
app.
`http://localhost:9000/sync.html` - is a debug page, which I use most often.

If you decide to create your own debug page I suggest you to add a `/debug/js/reloader.js` script to your page, as it's
done in case of `/tests/tests.html` and other pages, and your page will be reloaded on each change of the library source
code.

## Tests

There are some automatic tests. In order to run them you should run `pnpm start` and then
open `http://localhost:9000/tests`.

The tests are run automatically when the page loads. If everything is ok, you will see that all messages are green. If
you see a green message with an orange message, it means that a test has passed, but your browser differs from mine. The
thing is that different browsers differently render `.png` files, which are used for tests. So I use Opera, and all
tests pass well in my case. In case of other browsers there may be some problems. So, if you use Mozilla, you should
write `about:config` in the address line and then find the parameter `gfx.color_management.mode` and set it to `0`.
After it, all tests should be green, except for one, which has an orange message as well.

When you change the source code of the library, you may open the tests page (which reloads automatically) and check
whether your changes break the current functionality or not.

## Build process

The library is built with Rollup. I chose it rather than Webpack, since Rollup creates a very simple and light bundle (
eventually it just copies all classes in one file in right order and wrap them with an anonymous function).

All files are es6 modules with corresponding import and export statements. So when you create a new file, it's
automatically added to the bundle (if you import something from it to the other files).
